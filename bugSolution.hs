This improved Haskell code uses exception handling to gracefully manage the potential `IOError` during file reading. The `catch` block handles the exception, providing a more robust solution.
```haskell
import System.IO

main :: IO ()
main = do
  result <- try (readFile "my_file.txt")
  case result of
    Left err -> print (show err) --Handle Error
    Right contents -> putStrLn contents
```
