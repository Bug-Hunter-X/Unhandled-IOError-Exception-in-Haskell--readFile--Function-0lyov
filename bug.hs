This Haskell code attempts to use the `readFile` function to read a file, but it does not handle the `IOError` exception that can occur if the file is not found or cannot be read. This can lead to program crashes or unexpected behavior. 
```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  contents <- readFile "my_file.txt"
  putStrLn contents
```
